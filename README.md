# Hello-World
A first step to a new beginning.
I enjoy programming whilst listening to classic rock songs.
I have little expirience whith programming, but I have been practicing.
Some of my favorite artist are Jimi Hendrix, Areosmith & Queen.
I built my own PC & I do have expirience with mostly Windows, but MacOS is something I have used before.
